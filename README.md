# php-image-resizer-class

PHP Class to resize images on the fly mostly while coding in HTML

This Image Resizer class is a part of my project on www.dpedit.tk I tot to share this, thinking it would be useful, doh its just a simple version of the actual one i use in my picture editor project but simple enough to do the work, and for the brave developers out there you can use this script to resize images as it is uploaded to a particular size you require of your users, also can be used to create thumbnail images..
